# Drowsiness Detection Using ECG From a Wearable Sensores Using an Autoencoder Deep Learning Model

This project commenced for Master Degree Thesis. Currently submitted in ICIESS 2024. Utilizes ECG signal from wearable sensor that feeds into 1DCNN Autoencoder that detect drowsiness and reconstruct the signal back to be analyzed with Bayesian Statistics.
